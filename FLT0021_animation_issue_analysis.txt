FLT0021 ANIMATION ISSUE ANALYSIS
================================

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
FLT0021 is starting at its destination (YSSY) before flying to its origin (YSWG), causing backwards animation behavior.

ROOT CAUSE:
The route data for FLT0021 has incorrect timestamps for the destination airport.

DATA ANALYSIS:
==============

FLT0021 Route Data (from temp/routes_with_added_interpolated_points.json):

1. DEPARTURE: YSWG (Wagga Wagga) at time "1005"
   - lat: -35.165278
   - lon: 147.466389
   - altitude: 724

2. DESTINATION: YSSY (Sydney) at time "1005"  ← PROBLEM HERE
   - lat: -33.946
   - lon: 151.177111
   - altitude: 21

3. FINAL ARRIVAL: YSSY (Sydney) at time "1047"  ← CORRECT TIME
   - lat: -33.946
   - lon: 151.177111
   - altitude: 2500

PROBLEM:
- Both departure (YSWG) and destination (YSSY) have the SAME timestamp "1005"
- This causes the animation to show the aircraft starting at both locations simultaneously
- The aircraft appears to start at the destination (YSSY) before flying to the origin (YSWG)

CORRECT BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE:
- Departure (YSWG): time "1005" ✓
- Destination (YSSY): time "1047" (not "1005") ✗

ANIMATION IMPACT:
================
- Aircraft appears to start at Sydney (YSSY) at 10:05
- Then flies backwards to Wagga Wagga (YSWG)
- Then flies forward to Sydney (YSSY) again
- This creates a confusing backwards-then-forwards animation

FIX REQUIRED:
=============
The destination airport waypoint in the route data should have timestamp "1047" instead of "1005".

Location in data: temp/routes_with_added_interpolated_points.json
Line: ~26680 (second waypoint in FLT0021 route)

Current incorrect data:
{
  "lat": -33.946,
  "lon": 151.177111,
  "altitude": 21,
  "time": "1005",  ← SHOULD BE "1047"
  "name": "YSSY"
}

Should be:
{
  "lat": -33.946,
  "lon": 151.177111,
  "altitude": 21,
  "time": "1047",  ← CORRECTED
  "name": "YSSY"
}

BACKEND FIX NEEDED:
===================
The route generation process in the backend is incorrectly setting destination airport timestamps to the departure time instead of the actual arrival time.

This issue appears to be specific to FLT0021 based on the data analysis, but should be checked for other flights as well.
